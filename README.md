## Problem:
When an e-commerce site is scaled and they upload 1M or more products, manual labelling of categories become difficult
## Methodology:
I have performed 3-tier product title classification on Lazada's dataset using LSTMs in this project.

Metrics Used for comparison:

- Accuracy Score
- Cohen's kappa coefficient
    - Cohen's kappa coefficient is a statistic that is used to measure inter-rater reliability for qualitative items.
## Data Source:
Source: Mined from Lazada (E-commerce website), data is also available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01000
Train Data Size: 11, 446
Test Data Size: 5, 528
